At the end of each year our social media feeds explode with "best year ever" yearly reviews.

And while it’s great to celebrate achievements, these posts often paint a picture that can make the rest of us feel like we’ve failed. Because we don’t have 6-figure business, or a large count of followers.

I have decide to offer a counter-narrative and provide my honest reviews of the past year.

So my 2024? It wasn’t great.

In fact, it felt like a failure in many ways. Despite having systems, habits, and planning routines in place, I ended the year realizing I had lost track of what truly mattered.

## Why I didn’t achieve what I wanted?

No matter how perfect your system is, if your planning is not connected to the bigger picture — a dream, vision, purpose, or whatever — it is useless.

You just process the tasks as they come in, without much impact. The results won’t compound and you will feel like a hamster in a wheel.

I have that connection, but I lost a track of it.

I use a bullet journal for weekly and monthly goal setting, and I leverage Notion for organizing almost everything else. And that was one of the problems. My goals were buried deep in my Notion and that caused a lot of friction for me to return to it regularly.

But that was only one of many problems. Here is a full list of the issues that prevent me to achieve more:

- **I didn’t check my goals regularly.** I already mentioned this one. My goals were buried in my digital systems, making it difficult to reference them quickly and keep them in plain sight.
- **I set too many goals.** I focused on some, ignored others, and ultimately lost track of what was truly important.
- **I struggled with prioritization.** I spent time on low-impact tasks instead of the ones that would move the needle. This was especially visible on Clipio. When I look back, I would have do a few things differently. Or I wouldn’t do some things at all, and instead focus on getting users and especially getting the product out of the door.
- **I underestimated my capacity.** With three kids, I had much less energy and time than expected. I had a trouble to create a time for productive work or have an little energy to push myself to work.
- **My goals were digital, my planning was analog.** I love Notion (I even built a web-clipping tool for it—[Clipio](https://clipio.app/)), but when it came to planning, I rarely wanted to open Notion to cross-check my goals. The friction was too high.

## Lessons learned and outlook for 2025

While 2024 was disappointing in terms of goals and achievements (aside from a more time with my family), it was also a year of learning. And I have learned a lot during that year and especially during my yearly review.

Moving forward, here’s how I’m adjusting my approach:

### 1. **Fewer Goals, More Focus**

Instead of juggling a long list of ambitions, I’m simplifying. For 2025, I have a single **overarching theme** for the year, written on a small card with just a few bullet points on the other side. My full-year goals live on a small sheet of paper that I keep in my diary — accessible anytime, anywhere.

### 2. Focus on what I can control

I will focus on what I **can control -** I can control how often I write, but I can’t control how many followers I gain.

### 3. **Analog Over Digital for Planning**

While Notion is great as a knowledge base and writing, my goal planning now lives in an **analog format**—it’s easier to see, review, and act on. And simplified, frictionless system means more regular check-ins with my goals.

### 4. **Building Stronger Systems and Habits**

- I set mornings are for **exercise or writing**, before I start preparing my kids to leave for school/kindergarten.
- I make some of my tasks time based - eg. when I want to write I don’t have task “Write a blog post”, but instead “Write for 30 min”. Short time make the task less intimidating and can easily fit into any day. And if I will be consistent I will certainly produce fair amount of content.
- I plan to focus more on my health (which sucks ever since I start working from home during Covid) - regular morning exercise, after lunch walks (even when home), more veggies.
- I will get a proper sleep (good, long sleep is ultimate productivity hack).
- Regularly review goals **on paper** to stay connected to them.

## A key idea: It’s Okay to Fall Short

If your 2024 didn’t match the highlight reels flooding social media, you’re not alone. The internet can make it seem like everyone is winning—building six-figure businesses, hitting massive milestones—but behind the scenes, most of us are just trying to figure things out.

And that’s okay.

The real key? **Don’t give up.** Keep iterating, keep adjusting, and most importantly—keep moving forward.

Here’s to a more intentional 2025.
