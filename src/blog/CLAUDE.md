# Writing Style Guide for Claude Code

This guide helps Claude Code edit my technical blog posts to match my authentic tone of voice while improving readability, flow, and accessibility for non-native English speakers.

## Core Writing Principles

### 1. Voice and Tone

**Target tone:** Knowledgeable developer sharing insights in a structured, accessible way

- **Personal but professional** - Use first person ("I", "my") naturally without over-emphasizing
- **Honest about experiences** - Share both successes and failures authentically 
- **Technically confident** - Show expertise through clear explanations, not casual language
- **Structured and thoughtful** - Present information logically with clear reasoning

**Examples from my actual writing:**
- "Let's make it clear. My 2024? It wasn't great." (direct, honest assessment)
- "I have seen and even built a bunch of apps with MobX. Most of them had 1 or more large global states that could be consumed anywhere and usually it became quite a mess very soon (and a testing hell)." (technical experience with honest assessment)
- "While building [Clipio](https://clipio.app), I had to implement authentication in a browser extension without a regular website." (factual, contextual)

### 2. Sentence Structure and Flow

**Natural sentence lengths:**
- Primary: 15-25 words per sentence (this is my natural rhythm)
- Occasional shorter sentences (8-12 words) for emphasis or clarity
- Longer explanatory sentences (25-35 words) when needed for technical concepts
- Avoid artificially short "punchy" sentences unless genuinely needed

**Paragraph structure:**
- 3-5 sentences typically
- Start paragraphs with clear topic sentences
- Use logical progression within paragraphs
- End with setup for next idea when appropriate

**Flow patterns I naturally use:**
- "However, while digging into the UI, I realized..."
- "So I have decided to..."
- "That said, it's still..."
- "In this article, I'll show you..."

### 3. Technical Language Balance

**How I handle technical concepts:**
- Introduce technical terms clearly when first mentioned
- Provide brief explanations without being condescending
- Use domain-specific terminology accurately
- Balance depth with accessibility for intermediate developers

**For non-native speakers:**
- Use clear, complete sentences with proper grammar
- Avoid overly complex sentence structures
- Define acronyms and technical terms briefly
- Use active voice primarily but passive when appropriate

### 4. Content Organization

**Article structure I actually use:**
- Clear introduction with context and goals
- Logical section headers that tell a story
- Detailed explanations with examples
- Personal insights and lessons learned
- Practical conclusions

**Section organization:**
- Use numbered points for sequential content
- Use bullet points for related items
- Include code examples with proper context
- Add asides for supplementary information

### 5. Authentic Language Patterns

**Transitional phrases I actually use:**
- "However, while..." 
- "That said..."
- "In this article, I'll..."
- "So I have decided to..."
- "Let's take a closer look at..."
- "Here is what I have learned..."

**How I express uncertainty or problems:**
- "I'm not sure if this is a bug or if this is intentional"
- "Sadly, I found only a few usages across the app"
- "Turns out there was a lot to figure out"
- "It wasn't an easy decision, but it will allow me to move forward"

**How I introduce concepts:**
- "Let's first have a look at..."
- "There is a lot I want to explore..."
- "I want to show you how..."
- "Below is a code that..."

## Common Patterns to Maintain

### Openings I Actually Use
1. **Direct statement of purpose:** "In this article, I'll show you..." 
2. **Context setting:** "While building [project], I had to..." 
3. **Problem identification:** "Turns out there was a lot to figure out"
4. **Personal reflection:** "Let's make it clear. My 2024? It wasn't great."

### Technical Explanations
- Present the concept first, then dive into implementation
- Use "Here is how it works:" before detailed explanations
- Include real code examples with context
- Explain the "why" behind technical decisions

### Personal Insights
- Share both positive and negative experiences
- Acknowledge limitations and areas of uncertainty
- Connect technical concepts to practical applications
- End sections with learned lessons when appropriate

## What NOT to Change About My Style

### Keep These Elements:
- **Longer, well-constructed sentences** - Don't artificially shorten them
- **Technical depth** - Don't oversimplify for the sake of "accessibility"
- **Structured approach** - Keep my logical, methodical explanations
- **Professional tone** - Don't make it overly casual or chatty
- **Honest assessments** - Keep critical evaluations of tools/methods
- **Detailed examples** - Don't cut down comprehensive code samples

### Avoid These "Improvements":
- Converting every sentence to under 15 words
- Making tone overly casual or conversational
- Adding unnecessary excitement or enthusiasm
- Removing technical nuance for "plain English"
- Changing structured explanations to bullet-point lists
- Adding artificial "hooks" or marketing-style language

## Actual Editing Guidelines

### Sentence-Level Edits
- **Fix grammar and clarity** without changing voice
- **Improve word choice** for precision, not simplification
- **Enhance flow** between sentences and paragraphs
- **Maintain my natural rhythm** - don't force shorter sentences

### Paragraph-Level Edits
- **Strengthen topic sentences** for clarity
- **Improve logical progression** within paragraphs
- **Add transitions** where they're genuinely missing
- **Break up walls of text** only when truly necessary

### Article-Level Edits
- **Enhance section headers** for better navigation
- **Improve introduction and conclusion** for clarity
- **Ensure consistent tone** throughout
- **Add missing context** where readers might get lost

## Quality Checklist

### Content Integrity
- [ ] Maintains technical accuracy and depth
- [ ] Preserves my natural sentence length and rhythm
- [ ] Keeps structured, methodical approach to explanations
- [ ] Retains honest, professional tone

### Readability Improvements
- [ ] Improves clarity without oversimplifying
- [ ] Enhances flow between ideas
- [ ] Fixes grammar and awkward phrasing

- [ ] Defines technical terms appropriately
- [ ] Uses consistent terminology
- [ ] Provides sufficient context for understanding

**Remember:** The goal is to enhance my authentic voice, not transform it. Focus on clarity, flow, and precision while maintaining the technical depth and structured approach that characterizes my writing.
